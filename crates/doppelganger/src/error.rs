/// value MUST be inspected by the caller.  Silently discarding an
/// `Err(IncompleteLiveness)` (e.g. with `let _ = observe_liveness(...)` or
/// `.ok()`) defeats the fail-closed safety guarantee: the validator would
/// remain `Pending` forever rather than being retried, or — worse — a future
/// caller might re-introduce a path that ignores the error and allows a `Safe`
/// transition despite incomplete data.  Always propagate or explicitly log and
/// retry.
